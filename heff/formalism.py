"""Bidirectional N²↔R² spectroscopic-parameter converter (B&C Table 7.2,
quartic-truncated).

The engine's rotational operator is R²-form (N²_op − Λ²·I). Modern papers and
the PGopher default are N²-formulation. A state dict declares which convention
ITS constants are in:
  'formalism': 'N2' | 'R2'
  'Lambda':    |Λ|            (REQUIRED whenever 'formalism' is set; 0 for Σ;
                               never inferred — spec §3, §6, §7)

`convert_formalism` rewrites the constants into the *other* convention — it is
just the (exactly invertible) Table 7.2 arithmetic, so N²→R² and R²→N² are the
same code with one sign — and sets 'formalism' to the new convention so the tag
always follows the data. 'Lambda' is read, never popped, left untouched. A dict
with no 'formalism' key is returned unchanged: no declared convention ⇒ nothing
to convert. That identity-on-absence is what keeps every legacy (untagged, R²)
entry byte-identical through the converter.

The engine wants R², so the load-time call sites convert only when the declared
formalism is 'N2' (molecule_parameters.get_molecule_params and the
Energy_Levels user-dict path). 'formalism'/'Lambda' are left in the returned
dict; the Hamiltonian builders read params by targeted key access, so the extra
keys are inert.

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-15-n2-r2-formalism-converter-design.md
(that spec describes the earlier one-directional, metadata-stripping contract;
this module is now bidirectional and tag-preserving — spec superseded here).
